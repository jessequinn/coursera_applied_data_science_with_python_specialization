# Applied Data Science With Python Specialization


The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data. Introduction to Data Science in Python (course 1), Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python (course 2), and Applied Machine Learning in Python (course 3) should be taken in order and prior to any other course in the specialization. After completing those, courses 4 and 5 can be taken in any order. All 5 are required to earn a certificate.

''' Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
    All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.

    Part 1
    The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning.

    The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.
'''

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2] == '01':
        df.rename(columns={col: 'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2] == '02':
        df.rename(columns={col: 'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2] == '03':
        df.rename(columns={col: 'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1] == 'â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col: '#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(')  # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0]  # the [0] element is the country name (new index)
# the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3]

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()


''' Question 1
    Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?

    *This function should return a single string value.*
'''


def answer_one():
    return df[df['Gold'] == df['Gold'].max()].index[0]


''' Question 2
    Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?

    *This function should return a single string value.*
'''


def answer_two():
    return (df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1']).idxmax()


''' Question 3
    Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count?

    $\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$

    Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.

    *This function should return a single string value.*
'''


def answer_three():
    df2 = df[(df['Gold'] > 0) & (df['Gold.1'] > 0)]
    return ((df2['Gold'] - df2['Gold.1'])/df2['Gold.2']).idxmax()


''' Question 4
    Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.

    *This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*
'''


def answer_four():
    df['Points'] = df['Gold.2'] * 3 + df['Silver.2'] * 2 + df['Bronze.2'] * 1
    return df['Points']


''' Part 2
    For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.

    The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.

    Question 5
    Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)

    *This function should return a single string value.*
'''

census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
# census_df.head()


def answer_five():
    return census_df['STNAME'].value_counts().idxmax()


''' Question 6
    **Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.

    *This function should return a list of string values.*
'''


# SUMLEV: 040 = State and/or Statistical Equivalent 050 = County and /or Statistical Equivalent
def answer_six():
    return census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50].groupby('STNAME')['CENSUS2010POP'].apply(lambda cp: cp.nlargest(3).sum()).nlargest(3).index.values.tolist()


''' Question 7
    Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)

    e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.

    *This function should return a single string value.*
'''


# CTYNAME: County Name

def answer_seven():
    return census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50].groupby('CTYNAME')['POPESTIMATE2010', 'POPESTIMATE2011', 'POPESTIMATE2012', 'POPESTIMATE2013', 'POPESTIMATE2014', 'POPESTIMATE2015'].apply(lambda cp: (cp.max(axis=1)-cp.min(axis=1)).max()).idxmax()


''' Question 8
    In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column.

    Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.

    *This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*
'''


def answer_eight():
    return census_df[(census_df['REGION'] < 3) & (census_df['POPESTIMATE2015'] > census_df['POPESTIMATE2014']) & (census_df['CTYNAME'].str.contains('Washington'))][['STNAME', 'CTYNAME']]

''' Assignment 3 - More Pandas
    This assignment requires more individual learning then the last one did - you are encouraged to check out the [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to find functions or methods you might not have used yet, or ask questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and tag them as pandas and python related. And of course, the discussion forums are open for interaction with your peers and the course staff.

    Question 1 (20%)
    Load the energy data from the file `Energy Indicators.xls`, which is a list of indicators of [energy supply and renewable electricity production](Energy%20Indicators.xls) from the [United Nations](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/excel_file_tables/2013/Energy%20Indicators.xls) for the year 2013, and should be put into a DataFrame with the variable name of **energy**.

    Keep in mind that this is an Excel file, and not a comma separated values file. Also, make sure to exclude the footer and header information from the datafile. The first two columns are unneccessary, so you should get rid of them, and you should change the column labels so that the columns are:

    `['Country', 'Energy Supply', 'Energy Supply per Capita', '% Renewable']`

    Convert `Energy Supply` to gigajoules (there are 1,000,000 gigajoules in a petajoule). For all countries which have missing data (e.g. data with "...") make sure this is reflected as `np.NaN` values.

    Rename the following list of countries (for use in later questions):

    "Republic of Korea": "South Korea",
    "United States of America": "United States",
    "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland": "United Kingdom",
    "China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region": "Hong Kong"```

    There are also several countries with numbers and/or parenthesis in their name. Be sure to remove these,

    e.g.

    'Bolivia (Plurinational State of)'` should be `'Bolivia'`,
    `'Switzerland17'` should be `'Switzerland'`.

    Next, load the GDP data from the file `world_bank.csv`, which is a csv containing countries' GDP from 1960 to 2015 from [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD). Call this DataFrame **GDP**.

    Make sure to skip the header, and rename the following list of countries:

    "Korea, Rep.": "South Korea",
    "Iran, Islamic Rep.": "Iran",
    "Hong Kong SAR, China": "Hong Kong"```

    Finally, load the [Sciamgo Journal and Country Rank data for Energy Engineering and Power Technology](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?category=2102) from the file `scimagojr-3.xlsx`, which ranks countries based on their journal contributions in the aforementioned area. Call this DataFrame **ScimEn**.

    Join the three datasets: GDP, Energy, and ScimEn into a new dataset (using the intersection of country names). Use only the last 10 years (2006-2015) of GDP data and only the top 15 countries by Scimagojr 'Rank' (Rank 1 through 15).

    The index of this DataFrame should be the name of the country, and the columns should be ['Rank', 'Documents', 'Citable documents', 'Citations', 'Self-citations',
    'Citations per document', 'H index', 'Energy Supply',
    'Energy Supply per Capita', '% Renewable', '2006', '2007', '2008',
    '2009', '2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015'].

''' Assignment 4 - Hypothesis Testing
    This assignment requires more individual learning than previous assignments - you are encouraged to check out the [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to find functions or methods you might not have used yet, or ask questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and tag them as pandas and python related. And of course, the discussion forums are open for interaction with your peers and the course staff.

    Definitions:
    * A _quarter_ is a specific three month period, Q1 is January through March, Q2 is April through June, Q3 is July through September, Q4 is October through December.
    * A _recession_ is defined as starting with two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, and ending with two consecutive quarters of GDP growth.
    * A _recession bottom_ is the quarter within a recession which had the lowest GDP.
    * A _university town_ is a city which has a high percentage of university students compared to the total population of the city.

    **Hypothesis**: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. (`price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom`)

    The following data files are available for this assignment:
    * From the [Zillow research data site](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/) there is housing data for the United States. In particular the datafile for [all homes at a city level](http://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public/City/City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv),  ```City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv```, has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.
    * From the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of [university towns in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_college_towns#College_towns_in_the_United_States) which has been copy and pasted into the file ```university_towns.txt```.
    * From Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the [GDP over time](http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp) of the United States in current dollars (use the chained value in 2009 dollars), in quarterly intervals, in the file ```gdplev.xls```. For this assignment, only look at GDP data from the first quarter of 2000 onward.

    Each function in this assignment below is worth 10%, with the exception of ```run_ttest()```, which is worth 50%.
