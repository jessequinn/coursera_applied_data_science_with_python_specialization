''' Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
    All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
    
    Part 1
    The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 

    The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.
'''

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2] == '01':
        df.rename(columns={col: 'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2] == '02':
        df.rename(columns={col: 'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2] == '03':
        df.rename(columns={col: 'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1] == 'â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col: '#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(')  # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0]  # the [0] element is the country name (new index)
# the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3]

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()


''' Question 1
    Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?

    *This function should return a single string value.*
'''


def answer_one():
    return df[df['Gold'] == df['Gold'].max()].index[0]


''' Question 2
    Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?

    *This function should return a single string value.*
'''


def answer_two():
    return (df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1']).idxmax()


''' Question 3
    Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count?

    $\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$

    Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.

    *This function should return a single string value.*
'''


def answer_three():
    df2 = df[(df['Gold'] > 0) & (df['Gold.1'] > 0)]
    return ((df2['Gold'] - df2['Gold.1'])/df2['Gold.2']).idxmax()


''' Question 4
    Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.

    *This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*
'''


def answer_four():
    df['Points'] = df['Gold.2'] * 3 + df['Silver.2'] * 2 + df['Bronze.2'] * 1
    return df['Points']


''' Part 2
    For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.

    The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.

    Question 5
    Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)

    *This function should return a single string value.*
'''

census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
# census_df.head()


def answer_five():
    return census_df['STNAME'].value_counts().idxmax()


''' Question 6
    **Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.

    *This function should return a list of string values.*
'''


# SUMLEV: 040 = State and/or Statistical Equivalent 050 = County and /or Statistical Equivalent
def answer_six():
    return census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50].groupby('STNAME')['CENSUS2010POP'].apply(lambda cp: cp.nlargest(3).sum()).nlargest(3).index.values.tolist()


''' Question 7
    Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)

    e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.

    *This function should return a single string value.*
'''


# CTYNAME: County Name

def answer_seven():
    return census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50].groupby('CTYNAME')['POPESTIMATE2010', 'POPESTIMATE2011', 'POPESTIMATE2012', 'POPESTIMATE2013', 'POPESTIMATE2014', 'POPESTIMATE2015'].apply(lambda cp: (cp.max(axis=1)-cp.min(axis=1)).max()).idxmax()


''' Question 8
    In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column.

    Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.

    *This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*
'''


def answer_eight():
    return census_df[(census_df['REGION'] < 3) & (census_df['POPESTIMATE2015'] > census_df['POPESTIMATE2014']) & (census_df['CTYNAME'].str.contains('Washington'))][['STNAME', 'CTYNAME']]
