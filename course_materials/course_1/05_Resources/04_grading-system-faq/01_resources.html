   Q1: When I make changes to my notebook, the code runs OK, but when I re-submit, the grader message doesn’t change?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A1
  </strong>
  : Despite the code being executed successfully, the changes you make to a notebook are not guaranteed to have been saved on the system, especially when you've been logged in to the system for a long period or been logged in but inactive for some time.
 </p>
 <p>
  To resolve this issue; try one or more of the following:
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    make sure the changes you make to the notebook are saved before submission
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    log out of coursera and close all you browser pages and then try again
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    try to submit offline, more on how to do so in the resources/ Jupyter Notebook FAQ section
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>

  <strong>
   Q2: Can the Mentors or Teaching Staff look at my assignment and help me fix my code?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A2
  </strong>
  : No, but Mentors and teaching staff can help you figure out why something isn't working. Since this course has thousands of learners enrolled in it at one time, one on one tutoring isn't something that we can provide. Instead, you are encouraged to post a question on the discussion forums for the course, where mentors will reply and your fellow students can benefit from the tutoring. When posting in the discussion forums, please be aware of the forum guidelines (below)

  <strong>
   Q3: My code is not working. Can I post it on the forum?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A3
  </strong>
  : yes, but you can only post as much code as is necessary to describe the problem. These short pieces of code (called snipits), must not give away answers to previous questions either, to ensure fairness in the grading. Post a small example, and if more details are needed to help a mentor or peer will ask in a message reply
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q4: I posted on the forum, troubleshooted my assignment, I am sure my solutions are correct, what can I do?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A4:
  </strong>
  You can raise a grading flag from that assignment’s submission page,
