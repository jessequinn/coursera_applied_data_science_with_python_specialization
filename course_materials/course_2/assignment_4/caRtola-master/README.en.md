> We'll be back in 2018 with great news! :sunglasses:

# :tophat: caRtola :tophat:

> This repository aims to provide all available data from Cartola FC since its creation in 2014. We also tried to predict the score of each player in the 2017 Brazilian National Championship.

## Data :memo:
You can access all Cartola FC's data in the folder [data](data/). The data is organized by year and there is a single file with all data merged. All files are in .csv format. Even the Excel may open it. :wink:

## Predictions :dart:

You can check the predictions results of our model in 2017 in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1knS8pE-JtIaeilUcjI_grIKBeox94QWAuMGKlfCfQSk/edit?usp=sharing). Each spreadsheet has the predicted players by our model and their actual score for that round. Do you think our model performed well? or not? [Enjoy our discussion, mate!](https://github.com/henriquepgomide/caRtola/issues/33)  :speech_balloon:

Oh, our predictive model is available for public domain! Do you wanna know how it got trained and how you can use it? [Check this out](src/python/An√°lise%20dos%20Dados.ipynb).

## Contributions :octocat:

The __caRtola__ repo is completely opened for new contributions. Do you wanna help us, but don't know how? We give you some ideas:

- Have you done some cool statistical analysis of _Cartola FC_  you would like to share here?
- Do you also have a model to predict best players?
- Or you have just seen a mistake in our data/analysis?

Feel free to submit a Pull Request or open an issue! We'll love to have it here in __caRtola__! :v:
