This module's assignment is
meant to be unique to you and will allow you to show off your work
in a portfolio should you want to. You can make the assignment
challenging and insightful and try and solve a real world problem. Or you can make it into
a surface level and demonstrate the techniques that
you've learned in this course. The choice is up to you. When you login to the assignment for Jupiter notebook,
you'll be given a customized question. This question will give you a region
in the world, as well as a topic. We try and generate the region at a city
level, but you're welcome to use data at the state or provincial level, as well,
or at a countrywide level, as well. As long as it could encompass
the region that you're actually given. The topic will be chosen from a list of
things that I am interested in seeing, sports and athletics, or political events,
or weather and environmental topics. And we might add more topics over time. After this, you'll be asked to find at
least two datasets available on the Web and use them to answer
a question of your choosing. Now, my motivation for
this assignment is pretty simple. I want to learn more about the world and I want you to help teach me through
good information visualizations. I want you to start to apply your skills
to real world data and gain experience starting with an ill-defined problem and
moving through the data collection and cleaning in pandas,
to data representation in that you live. Finally, I would love to share some of
the great looking visualizations from this course with others. If you do not mind we sharing
your solutions, just indicate so when you upload to the peer review system. I am looking forward to
seeing what you built.
